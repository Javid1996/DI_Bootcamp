// First Part

//  1 Create a JS file and link it to the index.html file.

//  2 Take a look at your html file, you should have a button with an “onclick” event. 
// This event is equal to the function playTheGame().
//  It means that when you will click on the button, the function playTheGame() will be called. 
// We will learn more about events next week ;)

// In the function, start by asking the user if they would like to play the game (Hint: use the built-in confirm() function).

function playTheGame(){
 
do{
    let conf = confirm("would like to play the game?");
} while(conf==false);
    


}
