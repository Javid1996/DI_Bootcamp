            <h2>The Venus Project</h2>
            <h3>Aircraft industry</h3>
            <p>
                The Venus Project is a nonprofit organization founded by architect and social engineer Jacque Fresco. Fresco with his partner Roxanne Meadows founded this organization with a socioeconomic model to develop a resource-based economy for human beings utilizing technology.
                Fresco, with his partner Roxanne Meadows, founded The Venus Project in 1985 and supported it in the 1990s through freelance inventing, industrial engineering, conventional architectural modeling, and invention consultations.
                Fresco worked on the “Project Americana” before The Venus Project, from 1955 to 1959. The project was mainly about environmental, traffic, and floodgates concerns.

                In 1970, Fresco formed an organization, Sociocybereneering Inc, based on the idea of technology and energy conservation strategies. Later, Fresco and his partner Roxanne Meadows purchased 21 acres of farmland in Venus, an unincorporated community in southeastern Highlands County, Florida for conducting different types of research about their futuristic plan of architectural design and city models. Fresco & Meadows then created buildings and other infrastructure to work on their idea of energy-efficient cities.  In 1980, Fresco, established a research center to experiment on resource-based economy and later named it “The Venus Project” after the town of Venus, Florida.

            </p>
            
            <h3>Key points</h3>
            <p>
                Jacque Fresco believed that the "Venus Project" is a holistic socio-economic system in which automation and technology will be intelligently integrated into all public areas with the aim of improving the standard of living, and not making a profit, unlike the modern system. Also, based on the fact that a person is a part of the environment, a new system of values of human existence is proposed.
                It is expected that the implementation of the project will give society a wide range of opportunities that will lead to a new era of peace and sustainable development. The introduction of a resource-based economy aimed at the benefit of all mankind should eradicate crime, poverty, hunger, solve the problems of the homeless and many other topical issues that are relevant throughout the world today.
