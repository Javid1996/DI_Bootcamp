            <h2>Introduction and early life of Jacque Fresco</h2>

            <p>
                Jacque Fresco (March 13, 1916 â€“ May 18, 2017) was an American futurist[1] and self-described social engineer. Self-taught, he worked in a variety of positions related to industrial design.

                Fresco wrote and lectured his views on sustainable cities, energy efficiency, natural-resource management, cybernetic technology, automation, and the role of science in society. He directed the Venus Project and advocated global implementation of a socioeconomic system which he referred to as a "resource-based economy".
            </p>
            <p>
                Jacque Fresco was born on March 13, 1916, and grew up in a Sephardi Jewish household, at the family's home in Bensonhurst, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. Fresco's father was an agriculturist born in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey), while his mother Lena was an emigrant from Jerusalem. He later turned his attention to technocracy.
                A teenager during the Great Depression, he spent time with friends discussing Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, science, and the future. Fresco attended the Young Communist League before being "physically ejected" for loudly stating that "Karl Marx was wrong!" after a discussion with the league president during a meeting. He left home at the age of 14, hitchhiking and "jumping" trains as one of the so-called "Wild Boys of the Road".
                As Fresco himself said, in 1931 he met Albert Einstein, a conversation with which Jacques remembered for a lifetime. At the age of eighteen, in 1934, Jacques began to engage in construction at a professional level.
                In 1939-1940, Jacques Fresco was on the Tuamotu Islands, where he communicated with the natives:

             <p class="quotes">
                   ... The most important thing for me was how these people distributed their resources among themselves - it literally opened my eyes. It was then that I realized how catastrophic the consequences of scarcity are and how much it affects people's behavior and the formation of their values. 
                  On the island, after catching fish, the natives just went around and distributed it to everyone in the area. There were so many fish that there was enough for everyone and even beyond that. Problems begin when, for one reason or another, it is not possible to feed an entire tribe. 
                  In this case, human behavior changes dramatically: they begin to hide food, steal, cheat, and even fight.
            </p>
            
            <p>                   
                 The events of the Great Depression greatly shocked the 13-year-old Fresco. Millions of people starved and eked out a miserable existence, while all plants and factories stood in their places, raw materials were available. But people had no money, and the whole society was paralyzed. The result of Fresco's reflections on all this was the ideas and developments outlined in The Venus Project.    
            </p>
                <p class="quotes">
                    Throughout the time, the main motivation that prompted me to do what I do was the contemplation of endless wars, crises, useless human suffering, poverty, corruption and the complete indifference of the authorities to people's problems. Serious incentives for me have always been and remain the incompetence of governments and the almost complete lack of proposals from the scientific community. 
                    Unfortunately, most people simply do not see the big picture: narrow specialization in individual sciences and disciplines prevents a universal understanding of the surrounding reality. Scientists and politicians look at emerging problems from the inside of the system they are in, while it is this system that is the main cause of these problems in the first place. I am very disappointed with those 
                    who are working so hard on the problems of terraforming other planets, when our home Earth is still war, poverty and neglect of environmental care.
